;; chapter 13 - Database Interaction and the Application Layer

1. When we talk of a connection pool, we're essentially talking about establishing one or
more connections ahead of time and making them available to our application anytime
a database connection is required. In this way, we deal with the connection overhead
once on application startup and benefit from connection reuse from that point onward

2. jdbc/query
   jdbc/insert! jdbc/update! jdbc/delete! 
Also of note is the ! suffix on three of the API calls. This is conventionally (but not
always!) used to indicate that the function itself will perform a side effect. In the
functional programming world, this can be deemed important enough to draw extra
attention to.
Inserting, updating, and deleting will indeed result in a side effect – that of changing the
persistent storage in some way. A query, by contrast, is a simple read function and will
have no effect besides data retrieval.

;; chapter 14 - HTTP with Ring

1. An important distinction to make between PUT and POST is that PUT should be used
when updating an existing resource or when we happen to know the unique ID of the
entity we're creating. POST is used solely for the creation of resources and does not
require us to know its unique ID. Instead, this ID will be allocated by the web service
itself and communicated back to the client via the response headers.
The full set of supported methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD,
PATCH, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. The first four of which are most
typically encountered.

2. JSON to EDN conversion leads to a loss of data. This is due to EDN having more built-in type
support than JSON (for example, sets and keywords)
